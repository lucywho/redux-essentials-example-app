# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial example app in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-3-data-flow ).

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and is based on the [official Redux Toolkit + Vite template](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates/tree/master/packages/vite-template-redux).

## Changes to the tutorial version

- changed `master` to `main`
- upgraded to React 19
- using formData in forms
- minor layout changes (which may or may not survive to the end of the tutorial)
  - moved "add new post" form to its own page, included a navigation tab and reroute to "all posts" on submit

## Package Managers

This project is currently set up to use [Yarn 4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage) as the package manager.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
